Understanding the Service Location Problem
-------------------------------------------

Most projects needs services, to share a code across the project.

But how to access the same object across the project? The Service Locators is responsible for location of these service-objects.

There are many ways to make services locatable, but the main ones are:

> `1. Direct Injection`

>
> `2. Singleton`
> > A static property in a well known shared object. 
>
> `3. Service Locator`
> > Combination of `Singleton`
> > > (as well-known Service Locator),
> >
> > and the `Injection` 
> > > (the located objects are injected).

> `The singleton pattern` is simple to understand and easy to use, but the knowledge of how services are located is spread across the app.

-----------------------------
Understanding the Tightly Coupled Components Problem
-----------------------------

In case of simple `Singleton` implementation - the references to the object are made throught the static field of concrete `class`.

If I want to switch the implementation, which is called via this static field, I must to make changes all across the project.

The `Type Broker` Pattern addresses this issue:
```csharp
public static class TypeBroker
{
    private static IResponseFormatter formatter = new TextResponseFormatter();
    public static IResponseFormatter Formatter => formatter;
}
```

This one makes a slightly better picture: the clients arent aware of an implenentation change, if happened:

```csharp
app.MapGet("foo", async (ctx) => 
{
    IResponseFormatter formatter = TypeBroker.Formatter;
   await formatter.Format(ctx, "Hi!");
});
```


----------------------------
Using Dependency Injection
============================

The DI is a step forward to a more flexible and testable app, which utilizes both the Injection and Singleton approaches:

```csharp
builder.Services.AddSingleton<IResponseFormatter, HtmlResponseFormatter>(); 

app.MapGet("hi", 
  async (
    HttpContext context, 
    IResponseFormatter formatter) => 
  {
    await formatter.Format(context, "Hi");
  });
```

The Middleware approach makes the dependency hidden entirely:

```charp

app.UseMiddleware<WeatcherMiddleware>();

class WeatherMiddleware 
{
    RequestDelegate next;
    IResponseFormatter formatter;

    public WeatherMiddleware(
        RequestDelegate nextDelegate, 
        IResponseFormatter respFormatter)
    {
        next = nextDelegate;
        formatter = respFormatter;
    }

    public async Task Invoke(HttpContext context)
    {
        await formatter.Format(context, "Hi.");
        await next?.Invoke(context);
        await formatter.Format(context, "Bye.");
    }
}
```

Consuming a Service in Endpoint
---

The `WeatherEndpoint` renders a more complicated case, since it's an entirely `static class`, so the `Dependency` cant be injected directly.

---
Getting Services from HttpContext.
---

The `HttpContext.RequestServices` property will do:

```csharp
public class WeatherEndpoint
{
    public static async Task Endpoint(HttpContext context)
    {
        IResponseFormatter formatter = context.RequestServices.GetRequiredServices<IResponseFormatter>();
        await formatter.Format("HI.");
    }
}
```

The `HttpContext.RequestServices` implements the interface:
> `IServiceProvider`
> - `GetService<T>()`: Gets service or `null`.
> - `GetService(type)`: Gets service or `null`.
> - `GetRequiredService<T>`: Gets service or `throws`.
> - `GetRequiredService(type)`: Gets service or `throws`.

> The drawback:
> > service is resolved per dependency (every time).

---
Using an Adapter Function.
---

As mentioned above, the request via HttpContext, injects a new dependency instance every request. 

A more elegant approach is to get service when the `Endpoint` is created:

```csharp
public class WeatherEndpoint
{
    // an adapter function:
    public static async Task Endpoint(
        HttpContext context, 
        IResponseFormatter formatter)
    {
        await formatter.Format(context, "Hi.");
    }
}
```

```csharp

public static class EndpointEx
{
    public static void MapWeather(
        this IEndpointRouteBuilder app, 
        string path)
    {
        IResponseFormatter formatter =
            app.ServiceProvider.GetRequiredService<IResponseFormatter>();

        app.MapGet(path, context => Platform.WeatherEndpoint.Endpoint(context, formatter));
    }
}

```

```csharp
app.MapWeather("endpoint/class");
```

---
Using the Activation Utility class.
---

For endpoints that require services, it can often be easier to use an `object`, rather than a `static method`.

The injection goes kinda automatically, via the `Reflection`

```csharp
public class WeatherEndpoint
{
    IResponseFormatter formatter;

    public WeatherEndpoint(IResponseFormatter formatter)
    {
        formatter = responseFormatter;
    }

    public async Task Endpoint(HttpContext context)
    {
        await formatter.Format(context, "Hi");
    }
}
```

```csharp
using System.Reflection;

public static class EndpointExtensions{
    public static void MapEndpoint<T>(
        this IEndpointRouteBuilder app,
        string path,
        string methodName = "Endpoint")
    {
        var methodInfo = typeof(T).GetMethod(methodName);

        if (methodInfo == null || methodInfo.ReturnType != typeof(Task))
        {
            throw new System.Exception("Method cannot be used");
        }

        // Create an instance.
        // Activator helps to locate services. Good job!
        T endpointInstance = ActivatorUtilities.CreateInstance<T>(app.ServiceProvider);

        // invoke a method
        app.MapGet(
            path,
            (RequestDelegate)
            methodInfo.CreateDelegate(
                typeof(RequestDelegate),
                endpointInstance));

    }
}
```
