----------------------------
Creating Transient Services
============================

The `AddTransient` does the completely opposite to `AddSingleton`. The instance of a service is created every time when the Injection is required.

```csharp
public class GuidService : IResponseFormatter 
{
    Guid guid = Guid.NewGuid();

    public async Task Format(
        HttpContext context,
        string content)
    {
        await context.Response.WriteAsync($"Guid: {guid}\n{content}");
    }
}

builder.Services.AddTransient<IResponseFormatter, GuidService>()
```

> `OUTPUT`:
``` 
(a random GUID per any request. Anywhere.) 
```

--------------------
Avoiding the Transient Service Reuse Pitfall
--------------------

However, if take any page from previous sample and just hit Reload, the GUID gonna be the same.

```csharp
app.MapEndpoint<MyEndpoint>();
```

So the `Transient` dependency is actually a `Dedicated Singleton Service` or smth like that. It's a bug.

```csharp
class WeatherMiddleware 
{
    public async Task Invoke(
        HttpContext context,
        IResponseFormatter formatter)
    {

    }
}
```

The ASP.NET Core will resolve dependencies declared by the `Invoke` method every time a request is processed, which ensures that a new transient service object is created.

It seems the Platform calls the `ActivatorUtilities`, which is able to deal with the `Middleware` only.

The simplest way of solving this issue for endpoints is to explicitly request services when each request is handled. 

```csharp
static class EndpointExtensions 
{
    public static void MapEndpoint<T>(
        this IEndpointRouteBuilder app, 
        string path, 
        string methodName = "Endpoint")
    {
        // get the method.
        var methodInfo = type(T).GetMethod(methodName);

        // checn the signature.
        if (methodInfo == null || methodInfo.ReturnType != typeof(Task))
        {
            throw new System.Exception("Method cannot be used");
        }

        // create an instance.
        T endpointInstance = ActivatorUtilities.CreateInstance<T>(app.ServiceProvider);

        // call the Endpoint method of the instance.
        var methodParams = methodInfo!.GetParameters();
        app.MapGet(path, context => 
            (Task)
            (methodInfo.Invoke(
                endpointInstance,
                methodParams.Select(p =>
                    p.ParameterType switch
                    {
                        HttpContext context => context,
                        // resolve here:
                        _ => app.ServiceProvider.GetService(p.ParameterType)
                    }).ToArray()
            ))!);
    }
}
```

-----------------------------
Using Scoped Services
=============================

> `Scope`
> A new Scope is started per every HTTP request,
> which means that a service object will be shared by all the components that handle that request.

Lets make a sick play with a Middleware which consumes three different implementations of same service:
```csharp
class WeatherDelegate {
    RequestDelegate next;

    public WearherMiddleware(RequestDelegate nextDelegate) {
        next = nextDelegate;
    }

    public async Task Invoke(
        HttpContext context,
        IResponseFormatter formatter1,
        IResponseFormatter formatter2,
        IResponseFormatter formatter3) 
        {
            if (context.Request.Path = "/middleware/class")
            {
                await formatter1.Format(context, string.Empty);
                await formatter2.Format(context, string.Empty);
                await formatter3.Format(context, string.Empty);
            }
        }
}
```

Since `IResponseFormatter` service was created with the AddTransient method before, each dependency is resolved with a different object.

> `TIP`:
> You can create custom scopes with `IServiceProvider.CreateScope`.

The next line will make a dedicated object, three copies, per every request:
```
builder.Services.AddScoped<IResponseFormatter, GuidService>()
```

But, hey, where did the different implementation gone?

-------------------------------
Avoid the Scoped Service Validation Pitfall
-------------------------------

- The `Service` consumers aren't aware of a lifecycle of the object.
- The `Scoped` services can be used only withit their `Scope`.
- Requesting a Scoped service outside the Scope causes an exception.


> An unhandled exception occured while processing the request.
> > InvalidOprationException: Cannot resolve scoped service `Plarform.Services.IResponseFormatter` from root provider.
> > ##### Microsoft.Extensions.DependencyInjection.ServiceLookup.CallSiteValidator.ValidateResolution(Type serviceType, IServiceScope scope, IServiceScope rootScope)

The extension method that configures the endpoint resolves services through an `IServiceProvider` object obtained from the routing middleware:

``` app.ServiceProvider.GetService(p.ParameterType) ```

-------------------------
Accessing Scoped Services Through the Context Object
-------------------------

The `IServiceProvider` grants access to `Scoped` services, as well as `Singleton` and `Transient` services.

It fits well with the most common use of scoped services, which is to use a single service object for each HTTP request:

``` HttpContext.RequestServices```

```csharp
context.RequestServices.GetService(p.ParameterType)
```

Only dependencies that are declared by the method that handles the request are resolved using the `HttpContext.RequestServices` property. Services that are declared by an endpoint class ctor are still resolved using the `IEndpointRouteBuilder.ServiceProvider` property, which ensures that endpoints **don't use scoped services inappropriately**.

--------------------------------------------------
Creating New Handlers for Each Request
--------------------------------------------------

The problem with extension method above that it requires endpoint classes to know the lifecycles for the service they depend on.

To remove that need, just create new object per every request:
```csharp
static class EndpointExtensions 
{
    public static void MapEndpoint<T>(
        this IEndpointRouteBuilder app, 
        string path, 
        string methodName = "Endpoint")
    {
        // get the method.
        var methodInfo = type(T).GetMethod(methodName);

        // checn the signature.
        if (methodInfo == null || methodInfo.ReturnType != typeof(Task))
        {
            throw new System.Exception("Method cannot be used");
        }

        

        // call the Endpoint method of the instance.
        var methodParams = methodInfo!.GetParameters();
        app.MapGet(path, context => 
        {
            // create an instance.
            // per every request.
            T endpointInstance = ActivatorUtilities.CreateInstance<T>(context.RequestServices);   

            var result = (Task)
            (methodInfo.Invoke(
                endpointInstance!,
                methodParams.Select(p =>
                    p.ParameterType switch
                    {
                        HttpContext context => context,
                        // resolve here:
                        _ => context.RequestServices.GetService(p.ParameterType)
                    }).ToArray()
            ))!

            return result;
        });
            
    }
}
```

> HERO: `context.RequestServices`

The approach above has a bit overload by creating an object per every request, its a payload.

But it makes the consumption a lifecycle agnostic.

----------------------------------------------------
Using Scoped Services in Lambda Expressions
----------------------------------------------------

The `HttpContext` could be used in lambda as well:
```csharp
app.MapGet("endpoint/function", async (HttpContext context) => 
{
    IResponseFormatter formatter =
        context.RequestServices.GetRequiredService<IResponseFormatter>();

    await formatter.Format(context, "Hi");
});
```

--------------------------------------------------
Advanced DI
==================================================

These are not required for majority of projects, but they are worth understanding because they provide context for how dependency injection works and can be helpful when the standard features are not quite what a project requires.

---------------------------------------------------
Dependency chains
---------------------------------------------------

When a class is instantiated to consume the service, its constructor is inspected and any dependencies on services are resolved.

What if a service depends on other service?

That makes a `Dependency Chain`.

```csharp
interface ITimeStamper
{
    string TimeStamp { get; }
}

class DefaultTimeStamper : ITimeStamper
{
    string TimeStamp
    {
        get => DateTime.Now.ToShortTimeString();
    }
}

class TimeResponseFormatter : IResponseFormatter
{
    private ITimeStamper stamper;

    public TimeResponseFormatter(ITimeStamper timeStamper){
        stamper = timeStamper;
    }

    public async Task Format(
        HttpContext context,
        string content)
    {
        await context.Response.WriteAsync($"Hello at {stamper.TimeStamp}: {content}");
    }
}

builder.Services.AddScoped<IResponseFormatter, TimeResponseFormatter>();
builder.Services.AddScoped<ITimeStamper, DefaultTimeStamper>();
```

When the dependency on `IResponseFormatter` service is resolved, 
the `TimeResponseFormatter` constructor will be inspected,
and its dependency on the `ITimeStamper` is resolver.

------------------------------------------------------------
Accessing Services in the Program.cs file
------------------------------------------------------------

It's a common thing to change the Services according to the AppConfig.

But, hey, how to do that, if the Services cannot be accessed before the `WebApplicationBuilder.Build` method?

The `WebApplication` and `WebApplicationBuilder` classes define properties that provide access to the built-in services that provide access to the application configuration:

> `Configuration`
> > This property returns an implementation of the `IConfiguration` interface, which provides access to the application's configuration settings (see ch 15)
>
> `Environment`
> > This property returns an implementation of the `IWebHostEnvironment` interface, which provides information about the environment in which the application is being executed and whose principal use is to determine if the application is configured for development or deployment.

```csharp
IWebHostEnvironment env = builder.Environment;

// Add diffrerent dependency chains:
if (env.IsDevelopment())
{
    builder.Services.AddScoped<IResponseFormatter, TimeResponseFormatter>();
    builder.Services.AddScoped<ITimeStamper, DefaultTimeStamper>();
}
else
{
    builder.Services.AddScoped<IResponseFormatter, HtmlResponseFormatter>();
}
```

--------------------------------------
Using Service Factory Functions
--------------------------------------

This stuff allows to make a custom `Service` instantiation.

There are factory versions of the `AddSingleton`, `AddTransient`, and `AddScoped` methods, all of which are used with a function that receives an `IServiceProvider` object and returns an implementation object for the service.

One use for factory functions is to define the implementation class for a service as a configuration setting, which is read through the `IConfiguration` service. This requires the `WebApplicationBuilder` properties described in the previous section.

Here is how a factory function for the `IResponseFormatter` service that gets the implementation class from the configuration data.

```csharp
builder.Services.AddScoped<IResponseFormatter>(serviceProvider => 
{
    var typeName = config["services:IResponseFormatter"];

    var implementationType = typeName switch 
    {
        null => typeof(GuidService),
        _ => Type.GetType(typeName, true)!
    };

    return
    (IResponseFormatter)
    ActivatorUtilities.CreateInstance
      (serviceProvider,
      implementationType);
});

builder.Services.AddScoped<ITimeStamper, DefaultTimeStamper>();

"services":
{
    "IResponseFormatter": "Platform.Services.HtmlResponseFormatter"
}
```

--------------------------------------
Creating Services with Multiple Implementations
--------------------------------------

It is possible to register multiple implementations, and filter them out, if the `Interface` provides some insight:

```csharp
interface IResponseFormatter
{
    Task Format(HttpContext context, string content);

    bool RichOutput => false;
}

builder.Services.AddScoped<IResponseFormatter, TextResponseFormatter>();
builder.Services.AddScoped<IResponseFormatter, HtmlResponseFormatter>();
builder.Services.AddScoped<IResponseFormatter, GuidService>();

app.MapGet("single", async context => 
{
    IResponseFormatter formatter = context.RequestServices.GetRequiredService<IResponseFormatter>();

    await formatter.Format(context, "Single service");
});

app.MapGet("/", async context => 
{
    IResponseFormatter formatter = context.RequestServices.GetServices<IResponseFormatter>().First(f => f.RichOutput);

    await formatter.Format(context, "Multiple services");
});

```

The `Service` is resolved by latest registered implementation `(GuidService)` in this case:
```csharp
context.RequestServices
.GetRequiredServices<IResponseFormatter>();
```

The other consumer knows about multiple implementations via:
```csharp
context.RequestServices
.GetServices<IResponseFormatter>()
.First(f => f.RichOutput);
```

----------------------------------------
Using unbound types in Services
----------------------------------------

Services could be defined with generics:

```csharp
builder.Services.AddSingleton(
    typeof(<ICollection>), 
    typeof(List<>));

app.MapGet("string", async context => 
{
    ICollection<string> collection = context.RequestServices.GetRequiredService<ICollection<string>>();

    collection.Add($"Request: {DateTime.Now.ToLongTimeString() }");

    foreach (string str in collection)
    {
        await context.Response.WriteAsync($"String: {str}\n");
    }
})

app.MapGet("int", async context => 
{
   ICollection<int> collection = context.RequestServices.GetRequiredService<ICollection<int>>();
   collection.Add(collection.Count() + 1);
   foreach (int val in collection)
   {
     await context.Response.WriteAsync($"Int: {val}\n");
   }
});
```

----------------------------------
``` <<EOF>> ```
