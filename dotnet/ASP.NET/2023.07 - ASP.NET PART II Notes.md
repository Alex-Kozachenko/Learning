So, what is the ASP.NET Core?
=============================

It's a web-development platform, which bears it essential role in receiving the request and generating the response.

It has three major parts, like:
1. Application Frameworks: RazorPages, MVC, Blazor, etc.
2. Utility Frameworks: EntityFramework, Identity.
3. Platform features: Middlewares, DI, Cache, and many others.


Platform features
=====================

It's a basis for a building a web-services on ASP.NET.
Every AppFramework is built upon these features.
It's main concern is to cover freaquently requested low-level details for a modern web-server, so it like extends the developer's effectiveness.
You can skip these parts and go right onto the framework of your choice, but more complicated stuff requires knowledge on the basis.
It's a cool one-filed approach to setup everything for the server, therefore this one-file could bloat-up pretty fast.

The Platform features contains:
1. Middleware
2. HttpServer
3. UrlRouting
4. DependencyInjection
5. Configuration & Logging services
6. Cache
7. Model Binding
8. Razor
9. gRPC
10. SignalR

The essentials are:
The `HttpServer` is a mechanism for HTTP I/O built in ASP.NET. Like low-level netcode. It's just wrapping up low level details of HTTP into a nice object and bypasses it onti the Middleware chain (aka RequestPipeline).
The `RequestPipeline` consists of `Middlewares` which are processing incoming request, and then generating the response.
Worth menti0ning that `RequestPipeline` is a highly customizable part of the ASP.NET.
Also, there is a `Service`s, which are just a bunch of any-class, which could be requested by Middleware or other Service.
The ASP.NET handles the injection of real instance of the `Service`. In many ways. Will see in `DI`.


Program.cs structure
==================

`CreateBuilder`   - Makes a basic setup for a server. Raises the ASP-system services, configs.
`Build`           - Sets up the application services, and builds the `App`.
`MapGet`          - Sets up an `Endpoint` for the `App`.
`Run`             - Tells the server to start listening.
`UseXXX`          - Sets up a `Middleware` for the `App`.

Endpoint vs Middleware
----------------------

Like mentioned before, the Request Pipeline consists of Middlewares.
However, the last `Middleware` in the chain, which has been targeted via UrlBinding, is an `Endpoint`.
So `Middleware`s more like bodyguards face-controlling every request, while `Endpoint` is exact target for a Request.


Frameworks
==============
MVC - Good ol' pattern "which describes the shape of app". It's getting deprecated after mid-10s, when the SPA risen. Still good for a large solutions, because of separation of concerns.
RazorPages - An approach where all stuff for a page is in one place. Requires less boilerplate code, stands better for little chunks of pages or maybe SPA subpages.
Blazor - a framework which allows to make a client side with a C# code.
  BlazorServer - executes client requests on server side.
  BlazorWebAssembly - runs code on the client.
