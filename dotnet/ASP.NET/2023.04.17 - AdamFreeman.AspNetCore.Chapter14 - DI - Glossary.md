`Delegate` - a `Type` which represents a method with particular `Signature`.

`Injected object` - the object provided from outside of the current scope (function, class).
`Dependency Injection` - the process of `Injecting` the object.

`Service` - shared set of code for consuption in any place.
`Locator` - a special service which locates the `Service`s.
`Register` - a way to introduce a service for a `Locator`.

`Middleware` - a component which observes the request pipeline.
`Endpoint` - the Component which responds to specific URL directly.

`Singleton Service` - one instance for any dependency.
`Transient Service` - an instance per every dependency that is resolved.
`Scoped Service` - an instance per every request for any dependency.

Lifecycles:
`Singleton` - immortal.
`Transient` - equal to Consumer.
`Scoped` - equal to Scope.

Known issues:
- `Transient reuse`
- `out of Scope usage`
