.NET is hi-performant, scalable, crossplatform, IoT- and cloud-ready, testable platform with rich KIT and compiler features.

The .NET is a set of `.NET Standart-complied` libraries, so it's modular by design.
Modularity is the key which leads to performance, scalability.
Every .NET app could be released with all dependencies, so the user doesn't need to install prerequisites anymore.
So the .NET apps could be installed side by side with radically different versions.
So, its much easier support.

Such side-by-side installation allows to replicate an app as many time as the business needs right now, 
so the technical solution is horizontally scalable in maybe infinite times, on-demand, right here and right now.

It's a cloud-ready, dockerized apps, which are abolutely isolated from each other, could be architectured in any way.
The microservices support comes here as well.
And the ARM devices.
Tiny apps, isolated, scalable, crossplatform.
