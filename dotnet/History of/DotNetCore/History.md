At the times of the .NET Framework 4.5, there were some tools for cross-platform development from enthusiasts, like Mono framework and Unity.
The Microsoft adopted this approach, and .NET Standard arrived.
The first releases allowed to write library code which is consumable by any Standart-comply runtime.
So, the ol' good Framework will consume Standart code, as well as Mono will do.
But, afterwards, the next platform arrived - the .NET Core.

The .NET Core, by that time, contained the "heart" of .NET inside, without irrelevant OS-specific code.
So the executable project on .NET Core could be built for any platform.
No need for separate executable projects like `Console.Linux` and `Console.MacOs`.

Since then, the Core 1.3, the journey of the One .NET has began.

The .NET Core 2.1 was a big one release, had a huge performance boost and extended the OS support.
> So `The One .NET` is a platform which supports multiple OS.

Later on, the .NET Core 3.x improved compilation and performance even further. Added new Json. Extended asyncs.
And the C#8 compliance arrived there. 
This is a part when the language starts to get exploded every year.

The .NET 5 came out at 2020, trying to declutter the version messing. Still not replacing the .NET Standart. C#9.
The .NET 6, at 2021, more like a final point of the Platform merge, and since that it's just evolving every year with new language features and library.

The later versions are extending the Platform capabilities on the ground which has been achieved at the .NET 6, at the end of 2020.
