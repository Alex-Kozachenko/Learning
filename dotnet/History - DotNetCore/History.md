# Prehistory

While the .NET Framework 4 was arising, there were some tools for cross-platform development from enthusiasts, like Mono framework and Unity.
Afterwards, this cross-platform approach found support from Microsoft, and then arrived the .NET Standart - the set of cross-platform API, and the .NET Core, as it's implementation.

> The .NET Standart is a formal spec that defines API, that must be available on .NET implementation, that complies with this spec.
/ Looking at .NET 7 or 8 nowadays, it looks like the Standart has reached it's full mature. The One .NET.

> .NET Core is a cross-platform, Linux-ready platform
> able to call Standart-complied .NET Framework libraries.

# .NET 2.1

Well, this is a big one.
Back at the 2018, it's been introduced a huge new platform (well, after the 1.3 and 2.0, ofc), which includes:
- Global tools
- Huge performance increase for build and run (from x5 to x10, or so).
- Linux-ready, ARM32 platform.
- NPM-inspired console
- New CoreFX library
- Tiered compilation with Adaptive optimization
- Source Link
- Self Contained app publish
