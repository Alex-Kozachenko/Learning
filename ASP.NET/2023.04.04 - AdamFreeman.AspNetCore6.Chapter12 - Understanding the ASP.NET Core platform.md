--------------------------------
PART I - Understanding the Entry Point
================================
> ###### `Keywords`: Server, Application, Endpoint

The ASP.NET Core platform separates the concerns between the `Server` and `Application`.

> `Server`: does the common work for any web-server:
> - accepts the HTTP request from outside;
> - manages the service dependencies for the app;
>
> `Application`: reacts on specific requests in specific terms of application logic.


> To setup the `Server` and supportive services call:

```csharp 
var builder = WebApplication.CreateBuilder 
```

> The `builder` is the `WebApplicationBuilder` which is used to register additional services.


> To finalize the `Server` setup, call `Build()`;

```csharp 
var app = builder.Build(); 
```

> The `app` is the `WebApplication` which implements the `IEndpointRouteBuilder`, which sets up a funciton that will handle HTTP requests with a specified URL path:

```csharp
 app.MapGet("/", () => "Hello World"); 
 ```

> Start listening:

```csharp
 app.Run(); 
 ```

--------------------------
PART II - Understanding the HttpContext
==========================

> ###### `Keywords`: HTTP, request, response

```csharp
HttpContext context; 
```

The `HttpContext` describes the HTTP request and the HTTP response,
and provides additional context,
including details of the user associated with the request.

> `HttpContext` members:
> - `Connection`: Returns `ConnectionInfo` object that provides network (HTTP) details.
> - `Request`: Returns `HttpRequest` object that describes the HTTP request.
> - `RequestServices`: Provides access to the services (DI-Container). (See 14)
> - `Response`: Returns `HttpResponse` object that is used to create a response to the HTTP request.
> - `Session`: Provides a session data associated with request. (See 16)
> - `User`: Provides a user data (info, details) associated with request. (See 37 38)
> - `Features`: Provides access to request features, which allow access to low-level aspect of request-handling (?) (See 16)

```csharp
HttpRequest request = context.HttpRequest;
```

The platform itself is all HTTP I/O across Internet.
So the `HttpRequest` is most important part of the context.

> `HttpRequest` members:
> - `'ContentLength'`
> - `'ContentType'`
> - `Body`: stream that can be used to read request body.
> - `Form`
> - `Cookies`
> - `Headers`
> - `IsHttps`
> - `Method`
> - `Path`: path section of request URL.
> - `Query`: query section of request URL. As Key-Value pairs.

```csharp
HttpResponse response = context.HttpResponse
```


The `HttpResponse` object describes the HTTP response
 that will be sent back to the client
 after finishing the entire pipeline.
- `'ContentLength'`
- `'ContentType'`
- `Cookies`
- `HasStarted`: indicates that response is already going to the client, so its unchangable.
- `Headers`
- `StatusCode`
- `WriteAsync(data)`
- `Redirect(url)`: sends a redirection response.

> `NOTE`: Setting the Response `'Content-Type'` is important
so the platform wont let to overwrite the `Headers` or `StatusCode` in any further `Middleware`s.

--------------------------
PART III - Creating a Middleware Component
==========================

> ###### `Keywords`: Middleware, function, class

> In order to enrich the app with domain logic, which triggers on specific request details, use the `app.Use` method:
```csharp
app.Use(async (context, next) => {
	if (context.Request.Method == HttpMethods.Get)
	{
		context.Response.ContentType = "text/plain";
		await context.Response.WriteAsync("Custom middleware");
	}
	await next();
});
```

> In case of a large `Middleware Component`, there is a way to introduce an object component:

```csharp
public class QueryStringMiddleWare {
        private RequestDelegate nextDelegate;
        
        // a ctor with `RequestDelegate` as parameter.
        public QueryStringMiddleWare(RequestDelegate nextDelegate) {
            this.nextDelegate = nextDelegate;
        }
        
        // The Invoke method.
        public async Task Invoke(HttpContext context) {
		        // pass the control further down the pipeline.
            await nextDelegate(context); 
        }
	}
```
	
> Class-based middleware components are added via app.UseMiddleware.
```csharp
app.UseMiddleware<QueryStringMiddleWare>();
```

At current point the primitive HTTP server could be implemented just by these concepts.

But the HTTP request could be the point of interest for multiple `Components`. How to plug-in multiple components to process an incoming request and/or generate the reponse?

Place them in `Request Pipeline`.

----------------------------
PART IV - The Request Pipeline
============================
> ###### `Keywords`: execution chain, stack, FIFO, control flow, HttpRequest, HttpResponse.

The `Request Pipeline` is an organizational abstraction for the `Middleware Components`, basically an `execution chain`.

This chain is built up by the `Platform` and starts from the first `Middleware Component`, to second, and so on.

The final `Middleware Component` ends the pipeline.

> `NOTE`: basically, the pipeline is an `FIFO` execution queue for `Middleware Components`, at the most simple perspective.

----------------------------------
Interrupt the execution chain
----------------------------------

Every `Middleware Component` is able to control the flow of the pipeline, by default, via the `nextDelegate`.

> `NOTE`: basically, the `nextDelegate` is just a recursive call, like a in a tree traverse algorithms.

> `Short-circtuit`
> > If the `Middleware Component` skips the `nextDelegate` call, 
> > the `Pipeline` execution chain interrupts right there, 
> > making itself the end of the chain of execution.

```csharp
bool shallPass = false;
app.Use(async (context, next) =>
{
	Console.WriteLine("Hi.");
	await next();
	Console.WriteLine("Bye.");
});

app.Use(async (context, next) =>
{
	if (shallPass) 
	{
		await next();
    }
    else
    {
		Console.WriteLine("You shall not pass!");
	}
});
```

> Output: 

``` Hi. You shall not pass! Bye. ```

> `NOTE`: set `shallPass` to true so the chain will proceed further.

> `CONCLUSION`: so, every `Middleware Component` can decide is request suitable to be processed further.

--------------------------------------
Generating the response
--------------------------------------

Previous section has shown how to interrupt the `chain of exection`, but not the `Request Pipeline`.

The lifecycle of the `Request Pipeline` doesn't end on the final `Middleware Component`.

The `Request Pipeline` goes back through the exectution chain until the unbouding the HTTP response back to `Client`.

This part is useful for generating the `Response`:
```csharp
app.Use(async (context, next) => 
{
    // just pass to next middleware.
	await next();
	
	// here the pipeline goes back.
	var statusCode = context.Response.StatusCode;
	await context.Response.WriteAsync($"Status code: {statusCode}");
});
```

> `CONCLUSION`:
>
> Basically, the `Request Pipeline` is a stack, where:
> - the `first` Component scans the Request `first`;
> - the `first` Component writes the Response `last`.


------------------------------
PART V - Footnote - Advanced techniques
==============================
> ###### `Keywords`: Branches, Terminal, Duo, Options.

---------------------------
Creating Pipeline Branches
---------------------------

At the current point, the execution chain looks like a static stack, with a way to interrupt the execution chain, but not to call some other Middelware.

The Platform allows to make different sets of `Middleware Components` by making `Pipeline Branches`.

> `The Pipeline Branch`
> 
> Is registred via `IApplicationBuilder.Map`
>
> Against specific URL:

```csharp
((IApplicationBuilder)app).Map("/branch", branch => 
{
	branch.UseMiddleware<SomeBranchMiddleware>();
	branch.Use(async (context, next) => {
		await context.Resposne.WriteAsync("Hi branch!");
	});
});
```

> `NOTE`: there is also a `MapWhen` method for specific triggering the `Middleware`.


--------------------------------------
Creating Terminal Middleware
--------------------------------------


> `A Terminal`
> Is a special type of a Middleware Component
> which always in the end of the execution call.

The previous `/branch` `Middleware` is a `Terminal` one, because it doesn't call the `nextDelegate`.

Hovewer, there are more descriptive way to add a `Terminal`: the `app.Run` or `branch.Run`:

```csharp
branch.Run(async (context) => 
{
	await context.Response.WriteAsync("Final component.");
});
```

> `Terminal/Regular Middleware Compoment`.
> > Class middelware component could be written
  in order to support a duo-mode:
  the terminal and regular middleware
  as well:

```csharp
class AdvancedMiddleware
{
	RequestDelegate nextDelegate;
	AdvancedDelegate() { } 
	AdvancedDelegate(nextDelegate) => this.nextDelegate = nextDelegate;
	
	public async Task Invoke(HttpContext context)
	{
		await context.Response.WriteAsync("Class-based Advanced Middleware");
		// call next if available.
		await next?.Invoke(context); 
	}
}

app.Map("/branch", branch => 
{
	// no .Use equivalent for Terminal :-(
	branch.Run(new AdvancedMiddleware().Invoke);
});

app.UseMiddleware<AdvancedMiddleware>();
```

--------------------------------------
Component Options
--------------------------------------

> `Option pattern`
>
> > Used by some built-in middleware components.
> 
> > Basically, its a Dependency Register for a data struct
>
> > Called before `builder.Build`, to register an `IOptions<TOptions>` service
```csharp
builder.Services.Configure<Point>(pointOptions => 
{
	pointOptions.X = 100;
});

var app = builder.Build();

app.MapGet("/", async (HttpContext context, IOptions<Point> pointOptions) =>
{
	// use the option provided by integrated dependency resolver.
	var pointOpts = pointOptions.Value;
	// see that defaults are used from above.
	await context.Response.WriteAsync($"{pointOpts}"); // 100 0
});


// Making the options pattern in class-based middleware component
//  is achieved by a simple ctor injection:
class PointMiddleware
{
	RequestDelegate next;
	Point	pointOptions;
	
	public PointMiddleware(
		RequestDelegate next, 
		IOptions<Point> pointOptions)
	{
		this.next = next;
		this.pointOptions = pointOptions.Value;
	}
	
	public async Task Invoke(HttpContext context)
	{
		await context.Response.WriteAsync($"Point: {pointOptions}"); // 100 0
		await next(context);
	}
}

// When the .UseMiddleware executed, 
//  the PointMiddleware ctor is inspected
//  and the dependency is injected
//  from the Services.Configure registry.
app.UseMiddleware<PointMiddleware>();
```
